Monorepo is well known concept of versioning our projects. But what to do if our organization is large? Many big tech comapnies uses monorepo and this is most common argument for monorepo. But is worth to mention that [Google](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146) have dedicated tool for it. On the other hand from DevOps perspective creating pipelines with monorepo is very easy, we have all files in one repo.

Should you use monorepo? For small scale projecti it could be usefull to have frontend and backend in one repo (especially when you have fullstacks in team), but in larger scale I would avoid using monorepo.
